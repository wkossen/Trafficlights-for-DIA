Hi there,

This is the simple Readme.txt accompanying my simple Traffic Lights Shapesheet.

This sheet contains four simple traffic light shapes:
- lights off
- Red Light
- Orange Light
- Green Light

I created these because I can use them in diagrams to highlite problem area's, show stoppers etc. But you can use them anyway you like. Draw up traffic diagrams to explain the rules on the road, etc.

Installation is simple. Extract the archive in your .dia folder while keeping the internal directory structure intact.

This is free to use, free to distribute, free to adapt, free to change, free to curse upon, anything you like really. See COPYING

It is also free to send me 'thank you' mail. Hate mail is 10 dollar per e-mail though, payable using paypal. You can send after payment is received. Thanks for caring!

Hope it's useful.

Kind Regards,

Willem Kossen
